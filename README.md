# Diamond-Painting Workbench

When "Diamond Painting" you're applying hundred thousands of sparkling resin rhinestones, one-by-one, on an adhesive color-coded canvas. Pretty similar to painting-by-numbers, but with more glitter. Tedious, but fool-proof and sparkling.

You'll need a few tools for it: a tray for the rhinestones, a stylus to pick them up, a little piece of wax to cover the tip of the stylus, maybe some tweezers to fix the position of single stones, and of course the stones themselves. These tend to clutter up your desk, especially if you are using your regular desk.

That's why I designed a modular workbench that holds and organizes your tools when working, and stores them when you are not working with them. It consists of three modules fitted with interlocking pegs to hold them together.

## Modules

### Left End Module

The left module has

* a little discard bin for unusable stones
* storage holder for tray
* holder for currently used stone vial

This module can hold either a single vial OR a tray, but not both at the same time. The idea behind this is that you can put the currently used vial here as a reminder with what color your tray is currently filled. When finishing the color, put the left over stones back in the vial and put the vial back in regular storage.

### Center Module

* 6 openings for rhinestone vials

This module can be printed several times to extend storage space as needed. The holes are for 25mm standard vials.

### Right End module

The right module has

* 2 stylus holders
* tweezers holder
* wax pad holder
* funnel holder (for collapsible silicone funnel - one came with my kit)
